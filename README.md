# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Made with basic HTML, CSS and JS, this website is a marketing landingpage, built to have acessibility and
be responsive to all different screens!

I used media queries in CSS for the responsivity, and the JS was used to built a customized hamburger menu (mobile menu).

Thank you for looking my project!
